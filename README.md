)
- Developed a dynamic system capable of tracking and visualizing power consumption trends for appliances in real-time, empowering users with insights into their energy usage habits.
- Implemented alert mechanisms to notify users when energy consumption surpasses predefined budget thresholds, enabling proactive budget management and cost-saving measures.
- Integrated voltage monitoring functionality to detect and alert users of voltage fluctuations, ensuring the stability and safety of electrical systems.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
